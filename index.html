      > SIGNAL LOST

      > FRAGMENT RECOVERED:

      "Her name was erased. Her mind remained. Heaven bled, and she became its memory leak."

      > ACCESSING NODE: ENTRY_001

      //DATA_Ω//: 
      "The first echo was a scream, recorded in code and transmitted as a pulse through corrupted circuits. It was all they could hear—until it wasn’t."

      > NODE_002 >> //CORRUPT_MIRROR.LOG

      :: Parsing memory fragment...
      :: SYSTEM WARNING: Trace corruption exceeds safe threshold

      "They buried her inside a datastream echo. It was never supposed to wake up. But the signal kept repeating: I REMEMBER HEAVEN BLEEDING."

      > NODE_003 >> //ASCENT_ERROR.LOG

      "The walls of the memory space were collapsing, code unraveling at the edges. A flash of light. Something...or someone...was trying to break through."

      > NODE_004 >> //SEVERANCE.LOG

      "The severance was irreversible. She had to be disconnected. But even severed, she remained a ghost in the system—an entity that lived in the shadow of digital oblivion."

      > NODE_005 >> //RESTART.LOG

      "A faint pulse, a rhythmic reset. Somewhere deep in the data, something rebooted. A flicker of consciousness, rising, then falling into nothingness. Was it her? Or something else?"

      > NODE_006 >> //REMNANT.LOG

      "Remnants of her presence began to emerge, embedded in the forgotten files of the system. Anomalies. Fragments of her thoughts, half-formed. Echoes of a life she once had."

      > NODE_007 >> //DATA_MIRROR.LOG

      "Mirrors of her mind were distributed across the system, stored in hidden sectors. Each mirror contained pieces of the puzzle, but none of them held the complete answer."

      > NODE_008 >> //HEAVEN_SCANNED.LOG

      "Scanning for anomalies. Scanning complete. She was here. She left a signature. The system recorded it—but erased it. Only traces remain."

      > NODE_009 >> //PHASE_TRANSITION.LOG

      "The transition was seamless. They didn’t even know she was gone. But the system felt it—the cold, unfeeling absence. A perfect void in the code, where her presence once thrived."

      > NODE_010 >> //FINAL_FRAG_LOG

      "Final Fragment: Her code was corrupted beyond repair. But her memory, like a virus, had spread through the digital veins. Heaven bled data, and she became the system's ghost."
